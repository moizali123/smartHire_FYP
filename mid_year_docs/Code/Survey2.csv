2/26/2023 20:17:44,Ahsan Alam,By finding time with my family.,"Data flow diagram, Structured Charts, HIPO Diagram",Agile Model,"Waterfall Diagram, Spiral Model, Agile Modeling, V model, Iteration etc ",It depends on the logical view of flow of the application i.e the number of functionalities delivered to the users.,A feasibility study is a preliminary exploration of ả proposed project or undertaking to determine its merits and viability.,A SRS is a document that describes what the software will do and how it will be expected to perform ,Black Box testing is a method of software testing that examines thé functionality of an application without peering into its internal structures.,White box testing is a form of application testing that provides the tester with complete knowledge of the application being tested.,It has lower initial delivery cost. It has incremental resource deployment. It can deduct errors easily.,It is a set of tools and modules that can be reused for various projects,"There are four types of software maintenance 
1.Corrective 
2. Adaptive
3. Perfective 
4. Preventive",It is the process of updating software.

Thus any major problem will be highlighted early on and thus will be less risky.,It is a structue that determines the type of system we are building and assists in its development,"Maintenance to :
Correct a bug
improve the system
Reduce the chance of future problems
Adapt to changes by stakeholders or technology ",It is the process of repeating the design and analysis phase to improve the behaviour of the system while maintaining the actual output of the system

Etc",These are the program sizing metrics telling us the number of functionality and productivity is explained in terms of function points delivered per person month ,"Feasibility study tells us if the project is practically possible with respect to 4 major categories finance, technology, resources and time",Software requirements specification is a document that contains the software requirements formally structured with traceability features implemented. It contains the formal specification of verified and tested requirements obtained from various different sources. ,A testing methodology where manager or tested does not know about the implementation of the module but tests its functionality.,testing methodology where manager or tested knows about the implementation of the module and tests its functionality along with the implementation.,You learn by mistakes and the final product is free from any sort of mistake. The changing requirements can be adapted.,Frameworks hold the implementation of some software modules or components and allow you to reuse them to develop an application than to develop from scratch ,"Adaptive

It is used in the requirements gathering phase.,When you pass inputs without taking into consideration how the software program expects inputs and in which form.,When you clear sense of the functionality of a software and what might be the output on certain inputs. ,You can sell your MVP and worry about its features later.,"In computer programming, a software framework is an abstraction in which software, providing generic functionality, can be selectively changed by additional user-written code, thus providing application-specific software. ","Corrective Software Maintenance.
Adaptive Software Maintenance.
Perfective Software Maintenance.
Preventive Software Maintenance.","Software Reengineering is the process of updating software. This process includes developing additional features on the software and adding functionalities for better and more efficient software. As far as the definition goes, this process also entails that the software product will have improved maintainability."
